Write appfile to nodes
Running problem size 30^3 per domain until completion
Num processors: 27
Num threads: 1
Total number of elements: 729000

To run other sizes, use -s <integer>.
To run a fixed number of iterations, use -i <integer>.
To run a more or less balanced region set, use -b <integer>.
To change the relative costs of regions, use -c <integer>.
To print out progress, use -p
To write an output file for VisIt, use -v
See help (-h) for more options
