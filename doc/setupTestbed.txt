This is an instruction to prepare three nodes with names hadi[0-1-2] as testbed for ProMon experiment.
Make sure all of them are updated 
	sudo apt-get update

installing C++
	sudo apt-get install gcc g++ 
	sudo apt-get install libelf-dev

installing MPI
	sudo apt-get install libopenmpi-dev openmpi-bin openmpi-doc
	sudo apt-get install  lam-runtime lam4-dev lam-mpidoc

Add the host name to /etc/hosts
	192.168.0.110 hadi0
	192.168.0.111 hadi1
	192.168.0.112 hadi2

ssh without password:
on hadi0
	ssh-keygen
	ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub hadi1 
	ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub hadi2

I did ran the same commands for other nodes.

Sharing home directory:
Installing NFS server on hadi0:
	sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server nfs-common portmap
add this code to /etc/exports
	/home/hsharifi  *(rw,no_root_squash,async)

Installing NFS client hadi1 and hadi2:
	sudo apt-get install portmap nfs-common 
	sudo mount hadi0:/home/hsharifi /home/hsharifi
	sudo vi /etc/fstab  (add this line)
	hadi0:/home/hsharifi /home/hsharifi nfs rsize=8192,wsize=8192,timeo=14,intr

Prerequisite for Slurm:
	sudo apt-get install libboost-dev

Installing munge (prerequisite for slurm next) 
first munge to be installed. installing MUNGE on all nodes
	sudo apt-get install munge
create munge key
	sudo /usr/sbin/create-munge-key
copy the key to all nodes
	sudo scp /etc/munge/munge.key hsharifi@hadi[1-2]:~/
Make sure that the key is owned by linux user munge that is created by munge.
	sudo chmod 0400 /etc/munge/munge.key
	sudo chown munge:munge /etc/munge/munge.key

Just restart the station and it should be running. if not try start munge by
	sudo /etc/init.d/munge start

For testing check the website (above)
http://code.google.com/p/munge/wiki/InstallationGuide

Install Slurm
	sudo apt-get install slurm-llnl
	sudo apt-get install slurm-llnl-slurmdbd

creating the slurm.conf:
	sudo nano /etc/slurm-llnl/slurm.conf

use the https://computing.llnl.gov/linux/slurm/configurator.html to generate the needed data for slurm.conf file
paste it in the slurm.conf

if you restart the station, all deamons should run automatically. If not run deamons:
	sudo slurmctld (on hadi0)
	sudo slurmd (on hadi0-2)

Utility to use the extended file system.
	sudo apt-get install attr

Add ",user_xattr" (" is not included) to fstab to /dev/sda1 file systems
sudo vim /etc/fstab
